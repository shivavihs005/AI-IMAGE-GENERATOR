This is a simple GUI-based application that generates images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion model. The application is built using Tkinter for the graphical interface and diffusers for Stable Diffusion model integration, with support for GPU acceleration (via CUDA).

Features
#Text-to-Image Generation: Enter a text prompt to generate images using the Stable Diffusion model.
#Dark Theme: A dark-themed interface for a visually comfortable experience.
#Save Images: Save the generated images in PNG format.
#Loading Animation: Displays a loading animation while the image is being generated.
#GPU Support: Leverages GPU acceleration if available for faster image generation.
